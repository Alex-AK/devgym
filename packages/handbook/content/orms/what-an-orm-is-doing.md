Every number and every statement below was produced by running it, against drizzle-orm 0.45.2,
kysely 0.29.4, typeorm 1.1.0 and better-sqlite3 12.11.1, which are the versions the workouts resolve.
These three libraries disagree with each other, so a claim here names one.

## The model

A row is a member of a set. An object is a node in a graph, with an identity and a lifetime. The two
stop lining up the moment a parent has more than one child, because a join repeats the parent once
per child and a list of objects does not:

```
what the database returns          what the code wants
order_id  ref      item_qty
1         ORD-1    1               ORD-1 -> [1, 2, 3]
1         ORD-1    2               ORD-2 -> [1, 2, 3]
1         ORD-1    3
2         ORD-2    1               2 objects
2         ORD-2    2
2         ORD-2    3
6 rows
```

Somebody has to do that fold. Which layer does it, and who decides what statements get sent, is the
whole difference between the two shapes these libraries come in.

**A query builder types the SQL you were going to write anyway.** Kysely calls itself "a type-safe
and autocompletion-friendly TypeScript SQL query builder"; Drizzle's tagline is "If you know SQL, you
know Drizzle". One call is one statement, the result is rows, and nothing is remembered between
calls. The fold from rows to objects is yours, which is why the Kysely workout's solution ends with a
`rows.map(...)` written by hand.

**A data mapper takes objects and works out the statements.** Fowler's definition is the whole idea:
"A layer of mappers that moves data between objects and a database while keeping them independent of
each other and the mapper itself." TypeORM's repositories are that layer. It folds the join rows for
you, it reads a row before writing over it, and it knows which columns moved, which is what makes
subscribers and cascades possible at all.

Neither shape is more advanced than the other. They answer different questions, and the cost of each
is the question it cannot answer: a query builder cannot tell you what changed since you loaded
something, and a data mapper will not tell you what it is about to send unless you ask it.

### The thing people assume is there and is not

Fowler's Identity Map "ensures that each object gets loaded only once by keeping every loaded object
in a map". That is what makes an entity in Hibernate or Entity Framework feel like the row: read it
twice, get the same object, change a field, and a flush writes it.

TypeORM 1.1.0 does not do this. Two `findOneBy` calls for the same row hand back two different
objects, and `x === y` is `false`. There is no unit of work watching your edits either: assigning to
a property does nothing at all until you call `save`. So "entity" here means an object shaped like a
row, not a live handle on one.

### Choosing between them

This does not resolve into a table, which is why it sits in a paragraph rather than in a page of its
own. Two questions decide it, and neither is about syntax. Do you want the library to decide your
statements, or to type them? And when you need a query it cannot express, what happens: Kysely and
Drizzle expect you to drop to a `sql` template and carry on in the same query, while a data mapper's
raw path usually means leaving the entity world and mapping the rows yourself. Pick on those, and on
whether the team can read a plan when the abstraction picks badly.

## Worked example

The same two orders with three line items each, asked for three ways. TypeORM first, with both of its
answers to the same join:

```ts
const qb = orders.createQueryBuilder('o').leftJoinAndSelect('o.items', 'item');

await qb.getMany(); // 2 objects, each with items.length === 3
await orders
  .createQueryBuilder('o')
  .leftJoin('o.items', 'item')
  .select(['o.id AS id', 'item.qty AS qty'])
  .getRawMany(); // 6 rows
```

Running the SQL from `qb.getQueryAndParameters()` by hand returns 6 rows. `getMany` did the fold;
`getRawMany` handed the rows over untouched. Both are the truth, about different things.

Kysely has one answer, because it does no folding. This is the orders list from
`slow-list-endpoint-kysely`, cut down:

```ts
const rows = await db
  .selectFrom('orders')
  .innerJoin('customers', 'customers.id', 'orders.customer_id')
  .select(['orders.id as id', 'customers.name as customer_name'])
  .execute();

return rows.map((row) => ({ id: row.id, customerName: row.customer_name }));
```

The `map` is the fold, and it is four lines because the join is many-to-one. Make it one-to-many and
those four lines become a grouping pass, which is the work TypeORM's `getMany` is doing.

Drizzle sits on the same side of the line. From `product-search-drizzle`:

```ts
const items = await workspace.db
  .select()
  .from(products)
  .where(or(ilike(products.name, pattern), ilike(products.sku, pattern)))
  .orderBy(asc(products.name), asc(products.id))
  .limit(limit)
  .offset((page - 1) * limit);
```

Read it as SQL and it is SQL. That is the deal on this side: no statement is a surprise, and no
statement is written for you.

## Traps

**Every total on the report is multiplied by the number of line items.** `getRawMany` gives you the
join rows, so an order with 3 items appears 3 times, and summing in JavaScript triples it. `getMany`
gives 2 objects for the same 6 rows. Decide which of the two you are holding before you add anything
up, and prefer doing the arithmetic in SQL, which is what `orders-report-typeorm` is about.
[What a join actually does](../sql/what-a-join-does.md) has the row arithmetic itself.

**I changed a property on the entity and nothing was written.** There is no identity map and no dirty
tracking in typeorm 1.1.0, so the object you are holding is a copy that the library has forgotten
about. Nothing reaches the database until a `save`, an `update` or a query builder call, and two
reads of one row give you two objects that can silently disagree.

**The types are green and the column does not exist.** A query builder's types come from a file you
wrote, not from the database. A Kysely `Database` interface declaring `products.archived_at` against
a table that has only `id` and `name` type-checks clean under `tsc --strict` and fails at runtime with
`no such column: "archived_at"`. Drizzle reads the same schema file its migrations are generated
from, which narrows the gap without closing it: the deployed database is still a separate artefact.
Green types mean your code agrees with your schema file.

**We swapped the ORM and the endpoint is still slow.** The library chooses the statements; it does
not choose the access pattern, and the access pattern is what costs you. A loop that touches a
relation is N+1 in all three, an unindexed filter is a table scan in all three, and none of them
turns 40,000 rows into a page. [N+1](../databases/n-plus-one.md) and
[reading EXPLAIN](../databases/reading-explain.md) are the same skills whichever one you picked.
