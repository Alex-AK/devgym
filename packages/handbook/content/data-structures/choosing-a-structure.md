Four containers, and the choice usually gets made by habit. Two questions decide it: how you find a
thing once it is in there, and what you are allowed to look it up by.

## The model

An array knows positions, not contents, so `includes`, `indexOf` and `find` walk it from the start
until something matches. A `Set`, a `Map` and a plain object take a key and go straight to the entry.
Which of those costs more, and when, is [what O notation is for](./what-o-notation-is-for.md).

Keys are where the four part company. MDN states the limit: "The keys of an `Object` must be either a
`String` or a `Symbol`." Anything else is coerced on the way in, and MDN says how far that goes: "Any
other value, including a number, is coerced to a string."

```js
const counts = {};
counts[404] = 1;
Object.keys(counts); // ['404'], the number is a string now
counts[{ id: 1 }] = 'first';
counts[{ id: 2 }] = 'second';
Object.keys(counts); // ['404', '[object Object]'], both objects made one key
counts[{ id: 3 }]; // 'second', a third object reads the same slot
```

A DOM node collapses the same way with a better disguise: every `<div>` used as an object key becomes
`'[object HTMLDivElement]'`, so a lookup over ten rows holds one entry. A `Map` takes "any value (both
objects and primitive values)" and keys on the reference, so ten rows stay ten.

Membership runs on `SameValueZero`, in `Map` keys, `Set` members and `Array.prototype.includes` alike.
So `NaN` is findable in all three and never by `indexOf`, which uses `===`. None of them finds an
object you rebuilt: `new Set([{ id: 1 }]).has({ id: 1 })` is `false`.

Order splits the same way. A `Map` and a `Set` iterate in insertion order, always. A plain object puts
its integer-like keys first: the spec walks array-index keys "in ascending numeric index order", then
the rest "in ascending chronological order of property creation".

The last hazard is the plain object's alone. An empty `{}` already answers to `toString`, `constructor`
and the rest of `Object.prototype`, which is fine until the keys are user data. A `Map` starts
genuinely empty, and so does `Object.create(null)`, "an object with `null` as prototype".

So pick by the key, not by the shape. A reference, a number you want back as a number, or anything a
user typed means `Map`; "have I seen this" means `Set`; keys you wrote in the source, where spread and
`JSON.stringify` have to work, mean a plain object; and position being the meaning means an array.

## Worked example

```js
const byId = { 10: 'ten', 2: 'two', banana: 'fruit' };
Object.keys(byId); // ['2', '10', 'banana'], integers ascending, then insertion
byId['10']; // 'ten', and byId[10] reaches the same entry
const lookup = new Map().set(10, 'ten').set(2, 'two').set('banana', 'fruit');
[...lookup.keys()]; // [10, 2, 'banana'], insertion order, still numbers
lookup.get('10'); // undefined, while lookup.get(10) is 'ten': two separate keys
```

Three entries either way. The object renamed two keys and reordered them, and the `Map` did neither.

## Traps

**Your lookup has one entry, and it is whichever row rendered last.** The keys are DOM nodes and the
container is a plain object, so every node stringified to `'[object HTMLDivElement]'` and overwrote the
one before it. Key it with a `Map`, which holds the node reference itself.

**A word count came back with source code in it.** One of the words was `constructor`, so
`tally[word] ?? 0` found `Object.prototype.constructor` rather than nothing and `??` never fired,
leaving `'function Object() { [native code] }1'`. Tally on `Object.create(null)` or a `Map`.

**The list reordered itself when the ids became numbers.** Integer-like keys sort ascending on a plain
object however you inserted them, and the string ids did not, which is why it broke only now. Use a
`Map` to keep insertion order, or an array of entries and [a comparator](./sorting-and-comparators.md).

**The dedupe kept both copies.** `new Set(rows)` compares objects by reference, so two rows parsed from
the same JSON are two members. Put a primitive in the set instead of the object, and
[the key function](./the-key-function.md) is about choosing which primitive.
