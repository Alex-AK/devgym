Every query below was run against the practice database (SQLite 3.51) and every result is its real
output. Window functions arrived in SQLite 3.25.0, released 2018-09-15. Postgres behaves the same
way except where a trap says otherwise.

## The model

`GROUP BY` trades rows for summaries. Twelve reviewed books become four genre rows and the titles
are gone. A window function makes the opposite trade: it computes over a set of other rows and
leaves the current row standing, so you keep the summary and the title.

`OVER` is what defines that set. SQLite draws the boundary plainly: window functions may only appear
in the result set and in the `ORDER BY` clause of a `SELECT`. They run after `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` and
`HAVING` have already decided which rows exist, which is the same processing order that
[WHERE against HAVING](./where-and-having.md) is about. A window function adds a column; it never
removes a row.

Three things go inside `OVER`, all optional:

- `PARTITION BY genre` — group by, without the collapsing. The calculation restarts for each genre
  and every row survives.
- `ORDER BY avg_rating DESC` — puts the partition in a sequence, which is what makes "first" and "so
  far" mean anything. Ranking needs it, and so does a running total.
- a frame — how much of the ordered partition this row is allowed to see. You rarely write one, and
  the default is the trap at the bottom of this page.

Leave all three out and `OVER ()` is one partition holding every row, unordered.
`SUM(revenue) OVER ()` is therefore the grand total stamped onto every row, which is the whole of
percent-of-total: `revenue * 100.0 / SUM(revenue) OVER ()`. Put an `ORDER BY` inside and the same
`SUM` becomes a running total, because ordering brings a frame with it.

The three ranking functions differ only in what they do with ties, which SQLite defines in terms of
peers: rows with equal values for every `ORDER BY` term.

- `ROW_NUMBER()` — 1, 2, 3, 4. Always distinct, so peers are separated in an order you did not
  choose.
- `RANK()` — the row number of the first peer in the group. Peers share a number and the next value
  skips over them.
- `DENSE_RANK()` — the position of the peer group itself. Peers share a number and nothing is
  skipped.

## Worked example

The four reviews of The Glass Kingdom, best rating first. Two of them are 5s, which is the only
thing separating the three functions:

```sql
SELECT rating, created_at,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY rating DESC) AS row_number,
       RANK()       OVER (ORDER BY rating DESC) AS rank,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY rating DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM reviews
WHERE book_id = 1
ORDER BY rating DESC, created_at;
```

```
rating  created_at  row_number  rank  dense_rank
5       2023-02-01  1           1     1
5       2023-05-02  2           1     1
4       2023-03-14  3           3     2
3       2024-02-15  4           4     3
```

`RANK` jumps to 3 because two row numbers are already spent. `DENSE_RANK` goes to 2 because one
distinct rating is. `ROW_NUMBER` broke the tie on its own, and which 5 it put first is not something
the query said.

Add `PARTITION BY` and that becomes the top-one-per-group answer. The numbering restarts for each
genre, so keeping `rn = 1` keeps the best book in each:

```sql
WITH rated AS (
  SELECT b.genre, b.title, AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
  FROM books b
  JOIN reviews r ON r.book_id = b.id
  GROUP BY b.id, b.genre, b.title
),
ranked AS (
  SELECT genre, title,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY genre ORDER BY avg_rating DESC) AS rn
  FROM rated
)
SELECT genre, title FROM ranked WHERE rn = 1;
```

```
genre    title
Fantasy  Songs of the Hollow
History  The Paper Road
Mystery  Cold Type
Science  The Restless Atom
```

The filter sits outside the CTE because it has to. Change the partition to `book_id` and the order
to `created_at DESC` and those same three lines answer a different question: the most recent review
of every book, rating and date still attached. That is the de-duplication idiom, and
[set operations](./set-operations.md) covers when to reach for it instead of `DISTINCT`.

## Traps

**Three rows in a row show the same running total.** Cumulative payroll, ordered by the year each
person was hired:

```sql
SELECT name, strftime('%Y', hired_at) AS hire_year, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY strftime('%Y', hired_at)) AS running_total
FROM employees
WHERE hired_at < '2021-01-01'
ORDER BY hire_year, name;
```

```
name           hire_year  salary  running_total
Ada Reyes      2018       210000  210000
Ben Okonkwo    2019       165000  533000
Cara Lindt     2019       158000  533000
Dev Sharma     2020       132000  888000
Elin Haugen    2020       128000  888000
Hugo Marchand  2020       95000   888000
```

Ben's row already contains Cara's salary. An `ORDER BY` inside `OVER` with no frame written down
takes the default, `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`, and `RANGE` frames by value
rather than by position: peers are always in the frame together. Three people hired in 2020 means
one number repeated three times. `ROWS` counts rows instead, which is what nearly everyone meant,
and since it counts positions the ordering needs a tiebreaker to make those positions deterministic:

```sql
SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY strftime('%Y', hired_at), name
                  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```

```
Ada Reyes      2018       210000  210000
Ben Okonkwo    2019       165000  375000
Cara Lindt     2019       158000  533000
Dev Sharma     2020       132000  665000
Elin Haugen    2020       128000  793000
Hugo Marchand  2020       95000   888000
```

Every row now adds its own salary and nothing else. The default is harmless when the ordering column
is unique, which is why `ORDER BY month` over one row per month is safe and `ORDER BY hire_year`
over twelve people is not.

**`WHERE rn = 1` is an error, not a filter.** SQLite refuses it:
`misuse of window function ROW_NUMBER()`. Postgres forbids window functions in `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`
and `HAVING` and says why: they logically execute after those clauses are processed. There is no
flag that changes it. Compute the window function in a CTE or a subquery and filter one level up,
which is what both worked examples do.

**The share-of-total column changes from row to row.** `SUM(x) OVER ()` and
`SUM(x) OVER (ORDER BY month)` are the same aggregate, and the `ORDER BY` inside the parentheses is
the entire difference: the empty window sees the whole partition and gives every row the same
number, the ordered one sees the partition up to the current row. A percentage that drifts down the
page means an `ORDER BY` meant for the output crept inside the `OVER`.

**A top-one-per-group query returned two rows for one group.** `RANK()` gives every peer the same
number, so `WHERE rk = 1` keeps all of them. That is correct when ties should all win and wrong when
the query promised exactly one row per group. `ROW_NUMBER()` always returns one, at the price of
picking the winner arbitrarily, so add a tiebreaker to the window's `ORDER BY` when two runs of the
same query have to agree.

**`MAX` gave you the date and lost the rest of the row.** `GROUP BY book_id` with `MAX(created_at)`
says when the newest review landed but cannot hand you its rating, because an aggregate does not
carry the other columns along, and an engine that lets you select them anyway returns an arbitrary
one. Ranking with `ROW_NUMBER()` and filtering `rn = 1` keeps the winning row whole. Postgres has a
shorter spelling, `DISTINCT ON (book_id)` with a matching `ORDER BY`; SQLite has no such thing, so
the window version is the one that travels.
