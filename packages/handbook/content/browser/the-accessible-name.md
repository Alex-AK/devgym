## The model

The browser parses your HTML into the DOM, then builds a second tree from it. MDN: "Browsers then
create an accessibility tree based on the DOM tree, which is used by platform-specific Accessibility
APIs to provide a representation that can be understood by assistive technologies, such as screen
readers." A screen reader never reads your markup. It reads that tree.

Every node in it has four properties: a role (what kind of thing it is), a name (what to call it), a
description (anything worth adding beyond the name) and states (checked, expanded, disabled). Your
markup sets all four, and usually it sets them without you writing anything.

Role comes from the element. `<button>` has the `button` role, `<a href>` has `link`,
`<input type="checkbox">` has `checkbox`. The `role` attribute overrides that mapping, which is why
ARIA in HTML says it is "NOT RECOMMENDED for authors to set the ARIA `role` and `aria-*` attributes
to values that match the implicit ARIA semantics": `role="button"` on a `<button>` is noise. `<div>`
and `<span>` map to `generic`, which MDN describes as "a nameless container element which has no
semantic meaning on its own". Nameless is literal there. `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` are
prohibited on it.

The name is computed, and the computation has a specified order. Accessible Name and Description
Computation 1.2 checks these in turn:

1. `aria-labelledby`, if it "contains at least one valid IDREF".
2. `aria-label`.
3. The host language's own mechanism: a `<label>` for a form control, `alt` on an `<img>`,
   `<caption>` on a `<table>`.
4. The element's own text content, if its role allows name from content. Buttons and links do; a
   text input does not.
5. A tooltip attribute, meaning `title`. The spec is exact about when that happens: "Tooltip
   attributes are used only if nothing else, including subtree content, has provided results."

The first step that produces something wins, so `aria-label` overrides the visible text below it
without any visible sign. And there is a sixth outcome the list does not show: nothing matched, and
the name is empty. That is the commonest naming bug by a distance, a control that has a role and no
name, announced as its role and nothing else.

`title` sits last for a reason. MDN calls its use "highly problematic" for people on touch-only
devices, keyboard users, assistive technology users, people with fine motor impairment and people
with cognitive concerns, and says the main accessible use of the attribute is labelling `<iframe>`
elements. Everywhere else it buys you a tooltip a mouse user might find, and little else.

Description is the fourth property and a separate one: `aria-describedby` adds detail on top of a
name and never supplies one. States are the properties that change while the page is open, and
getting a change noticed is [its own problem](./announcing-change.md).

## Worked example

An icon-only close button, which is the shortest route to an empty name:

```html
<button onclick="close()">
  <svg viewBox="0 0 16 16">…</svg>
</button>
```

Walk the steps. No `aria-labelledby`. No `aria-label`. `button` has no native naming attribute of its
own, since `alt` belongs to `<img>`. Name from content finds an `<svg>` that contributes no text. No
`title`. The name is the empty string, so all the screen reader has is the role: "button".

Two fixes, at two different steps:

```html
<!-- step 2: the name is the attribute -->
<button aria-label="Close" onclick="close()">
  <svg aria-hidden="true">…</svg>
</button>

<!-- step 4: the name is the text content -->
<button onclick="close()">
  <svg aria-hidden="true">…</svg>
  <span class="sr-only">Close</span>
</button>
```

The second is usually the better one. Visually hidden text is real text, so it gets translated, it
survives a stylesheet that failed to load, and it is a word the user can see and say. Either way,
`aria-hidden="true"` on the decorative `<svg>` keeps its contents out of the tree.

Tables are named at step 3, and this is the case nobody files under naming:

```html
<table>
  <caption>
    Revenue by customer, Q1
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Customer</th>
      <th scope="col">Orders</th>
      <th scope="col">Revenue</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Acme</th>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>4300</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

`<caption>` is the table's accessible name, and it has to be the `<table>`'s first child. `scope` is
the other half: it "defines the cells that the header relates to", taking `col`, `row`, `colgroup` or
`rowgroup`. That association is what turns "12" into "Orders, 12" as the user moves across the row.
Leave `scope` off and the browser picks the cells itself, which is a guess you can delete for the
price of one attribute.

## Traps

**The Save button works with a mouse and cannot be reached with a keyboard.**
`<div class="btn" onclick="save()">Save</div>` is missing four things, not one: it is not in the tab
order, it does not activate on Enter or Space, it has no role, and `generic` cannot carry a name.
Adding `role="button"` supplies the role, and the name follows, because that role takes its name from
content. The keyboard is untouched. You still owe `tabindex="0"`, a keydown handler for both of the
keys the button pattern specifies, and focus styling to match. MDN's warning covers the whole
approach: "Interactive components authored using non-interactive elements are not listed in the
accessibility tree." Four things to get right and keep right, against one element that has them
already. More on choosing it in [which element means this](./which-element-means-this.md), and on the
tab order in [focus](./focus.md).

**A screen reader announces "button" and stops.** The control is an icon with a click handler and
nothing else, so every step of the computation came back empty. `aria-label` on the button, or
visually hidden text inside it, gives it a name. `alt` will not do it, because there is no `<img>`
involved.

**Clicking the word "Email" does not focus the field.** The `<label>` is next to the input but not
associated with it, and adjacency is not association. Either `for` carries the input's `id` or the
input is nested inside the label. Association is what MDN describes: "When a user clicks or
touches/taps a label, the browser passes the focus to its associated input." The dead click is the
symptom you can see; the input having no name is the one you cannot. In JSX the attribute is
`htmlFor`.

**A voice control user says "click Save" and nothing happens.** The markup is
`<button aria-label="Submit form">Save</button>`. `aria-label` is step 2 and the visible text is step
4, so the word on screen is not the element's name. That is the whole of WCAG's Label in Name
criterion, "the name contains the text that is presented visually", so that "speech-input users (i.e.
users of speech recognition applications) can navigate by speaking the visible text labels". When
there is visible text, let it be the name.

**The screen reader reads the caption twice.** An `<img alt="Chart of quarterly revenue">` sits under
a caption already saying that, so the user hears it twice. If the surrounding text carries the
meaning, the image is decorative, and `alt=""` is how you say so. Empty is not the same as absent:
with no `alt` at all, "some screen readers may announce the image's file name instead", and the user
hears "chart-final-2 dot png".

**The report reads aloud as a stream of loose numbers.** "Acme, 12, 4300, 2", with no way to tell
which number is which. The header row is marked up with `<td>`, so the table contains no headers to
pair the cells with, and it has no `<caption>`, so it has no name to find it by either. Use
`<th scope="col">` across the header row and `<th scope="row">` at the start of each data row, and
the pairing comes back.
