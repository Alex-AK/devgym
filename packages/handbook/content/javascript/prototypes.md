Four different bugs share one model: reads and writes do not travel the same path, `this` is decided
by the call rather than by the definition, and `{}` arrives with properties in it. Get the model
wrong and all four look like separate mysteries.

## The model

**A read walks the chain. A write does not.** Reading a property looks at the object, then its
prototype, then that object's prototype, until the chain hits `null`. Writing is one step: MDN puts
it plainly, "setting a property to an object creates an own property", with getters and setters as
the only exception. So the read and the write in `obj.count++` can address two different objects, and
the write always lands on the one in your hand.

That asymmetry has a name in the same document, **property shadowing**: the new own property does not
overwrite the inherited one, it hides it. The prototype still holds the old value, and every other
object inheriting from it still sees it.

**`this` is an argument, and the call site supplies it.** For an ordinary function `this` is whatever
the invocation gave it: the object before the dot for a method call, `undefined` in strict mode for a
bare call, and whatever `bind` or `call` pinned otherwise. Pulling a method out of an object throws
the receiver away, which is why a method passed as a callback stops working. Arrow functions are the
exception that makes it usable: they have no `this` of their own and close over the one in scope where
they were written.

**`{}` is not empty.** It inherits from `Object.prototype`, so `toString`, `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty`
and `constructor` are all readable on it before you put anything in. An object used as a lookup table
is therefore pre-populated with keys you did not choose, and `__proto__` is worse than pre-populated:
assigning to it changes the prototype instead of storing a value.

## Worked example

Two objects, one prototype, and a counter that stops being shared:

```js
const defaults = { hits: 0 };
const session = Object.create(defaults);

session.hits++; // read walks up to defaults (0), write lands on session
session.hits; // 1
defaults.hits; // 0 — untouched
Object.hasOwn(session, 'hits'); // true — the write created this

const other = Object.create(defaults);
other.hits; // 0 — every session starts over
```

And the lookup table that is not empty:

```js
const counts = {};
counts['toString'] ?? 0; // the function, not 0 — so `?? 0` never fires

const safe = Object.create(null); // no prototype, no inherited anything
safe.toString; // undefined

const byId = new Map(); // keeps any key as itself, including 404 as a number
```

Every line above is output from running it, including the one people disbelieve: `counts['toString']`
is a function, so `(counts[key] ?? 0) + 1` concatenates onto `"function toString() { [native code] }"`.

## Traps

**The counter resets for every object, or the shared value never changes.** A prototype held the
initial value, the first `++` shadowed it, and now each object counts alone. If shared mutable state
is what you wanted, put it in a real container and mutate that; if per-object state is what you
wanted, initialise it as an own property in the constructor rather than leaning on the prototype.

**`this` is undefined inside a callback.** `emitter.on('x', logger.log)` passes the function without
the object, so the call site provides no receiver. `logger.log.bind(logger)`, an arrow wrapper, or an
arrow-function class field all fix it; the class field costs one function per instance rather than one
per class, which only matters when there are many instances.

**A key from user data behaves strangely.** `"toString"` reads back as a function, `"__proto__"`
silently changes the prototype rather than being stored, and a numeric id becomes the string `"404"`
because object keys always are strings. `Object.create(null)` removes the first two; a `Map` removes
all three and keeps insertion order, which makes it the right default whenever the keys come from
outside your code.
