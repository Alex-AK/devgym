## The model

A cache is a dictionary, and everything it does well or badly follows from what is in the key.

RFC 9111 sets the floor: the cache key "is composed from, at a minimum, the request method and
target URI used to retrieve the stored response". Target URI includes the query string, so
`/pricing` and `/pricing?utm_source=twitter` are two objects that happen to have identical bodies.

`Vary` is how the server adds to that key. Naming `Accept-Language` in it, MDN says, "causes the
cache to be keyed based on a composite of the response URL and the `Accept-Language` request header"
instead of on the URL alone. RFC 9111 words the same thing as a matching rule, and that phrasing is
the one that explains the failure: a cache "MUST NOT use that
stored response without revalidation unless all the presented request header fields nominated by
that `Vary` field value match those fields in the original request". A stored entry that rarely
matches is a stored entry that is rarely used.

So the cost of a `Vary` is the number of distinct values the named header takes:

- `Vary: Accept-Encoding` — a small number of encodings, so the object is stored a few times over.
  This is the one you want.
- `Vary: Accept-Language` — one entry per language you actually serve, provided you normalise the
  header before it reaches the key.
- `Vary: User-Agent` — MDN warns it "generally has a very large number of variations, which
  drastically reduces the chance that the cache will be reused", and suggests feature detection
  instead.
- `Vary: Cookie` — a session cookie is unique per visitor, so no two people can ever share an entry.
  The cache still stores everything and serves almost none of it.
- `Vary: *` — RFC 9111: a stored response with `*` in its `Vary` "always fails to match". MDN puts
  it as: this implies the response is uncacheable.

The other half is what you are allowed to store at all. RFC 9111 keeps a shared cache honest without
your help on one case: it "MUST NOT use a cached response to a request with an `Authorization`
header field to satisfy any subsequent request" unless a directive such as `public`, `s-maxage` or
`must-revalidate` says otherwise. Cookies get no such protection, which is exactly why personalised
pages need `private` on them and not just a short lifetime.

## Worked example

The response that produces a 2% hit rate, and the one that fixes it:

```http
# Before: keyed on the visitor, so every entry is written once and read never.
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
Vary: Cookie, User-Agent, Accept-Encoding
```

```http
# After: the same object, stored once per encoding.
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
Vary: Accept-Encoding
```

That is only correct if the response really is the same for everyone, which is the decision `Vary`
was hiding. Split the two kinds of response apart and each gets an honest answer:

```http
# The shell, the assets, the marketing pages: shared, no personalisation in them.
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
Vary: Accept-Encoding

# The dashboard, which is different for every visitor.
Cache-Control: private, no-cache
```

`private` keeps it out of every shared cache; `no-cache` keeps the browser's own copy but makes it
ask before reusing it.

## Traps

**The hit rate is 2% and the CDN configuration looks right.** Read the response headers before you
read the configuration. `Vary` is often set by middleware rather than by the handler you are
looking at, and a `Vary: Cookie` that landed on responses with nothing to do with the session is the
usual answer. The CDN is doing exactly what it was told.

**One user is served another user's page.** The opposite failure, and worse. A personalised response
went out as `public` with no `Vary` and no `private`. Note that `no-cache` alone does not save you
here: MDN's request collapse describes a shared cache forwarding one request on behalf of many
identical simultaneous ones, and "even if `max-age=0` or `no-cache` is given in the response, it
will be reused" for that group. The directive that opts out is `private`.

**Every campaign link is a miss.** Tracking parameters are in the URI and therefore in the key, so
each source spawns a new object for a page whose content does not depend on them. Normalise at the
edge: drop the query parameters the origin never reads, and sort the ones it does.

**Two requests for every API call.** The `OPTIONS` preflight is answered from a different cache with
a different key. `Access-Control-Max-Age` sets how long the browser may reuse the
`Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` answer for that origin, method and
header set. The default is five seconds, and browsers cap what you ask for: MDN gives 24 hours for
Firefox and two hours for Chromium since version 76. `http-preflight-cache` is this one directly.
