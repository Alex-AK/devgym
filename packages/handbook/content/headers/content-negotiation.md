## The model

One URL, more than one representation. Negotiation is how the two ends agree on which one, and it
runs in three parts.

The client states preferences up front. `Accept` for media types, `Accept-Encoding` for compression,
`Accept-Language` for languages, each an ordered list with optional quality values from 0 to 1,
where an absent `q` means 1. RFC 9110 calls this proactive negotiation, and it is the only kind you
will meet in practice.

The server picks one representation and describes what it picked. `Content-Type` gives the media
type and its parameters, `Content-Encoding` names the compression applied on top, `Content-Language`
the language. `Content-Encoding` is end to end and describes the resource itself, so when it is
present `Content-Length` counts the compressed bytes, not the original. On a request these same
headers describe the body you are sending rather than the one you want back.

Then the response has to admit what the choice depended on. That is `Vary`: a list of request header
names that fed into the selection. A cache keys stored responses on the URL, and `Vary` extends that
key to include the named headers. `Vary: Accept-Language` means the copy stored for a Spanish
speaker will not be handed to a French one. No `Vary` means the cache believes the URL is the whole
story, and hands the first response it saw to everybody.

## Worked example

An endpoint that serves the same report as JSON or CSV:

```js
app.get('/report', (req, res) => {
  // The answer depends on this request header, so say so before choosing.
  res.vary('Accept');

  const accept = req.get('accept') ?? '*/*';
  if (accept.includes('text/csv')) {
    res.type('text/csv').send(toCsv(report));
    return;
  }
  if (accept.includes('application/json') || accept.includes('*/*')) {
    res.json(report);
    return;
  }
  res.sendStatus(406);
});
```

The `res.vary('Accept')` is the line people leave out, and it is the one that decides whether a
shared cache can serve this URL correctly at all.

The substring test is a shortcut worth knowing the limits of. A browser navigating to this URL sends
`Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8`, and curl sends `*/*`.
Ranking those properly means parsing the list and sorting by `q`, which is what a negotiation
library is for. Two acceptable types with different weights is where the shortcut gives the wrong
answer.

## Traps

**The endpoint returns JSON in curl and an HTML error page in the browser.** Nothing changed except
`Accept`. curl asks for `*/*` and takes whatever arrives; the browser asks for HTML first and only
falls back to `*/*` at `q=0.8`, so a server that honours the ranking answers each of them
differently. When you are debugging a format problem, compare the two `Accept` headers before you
read any application code.

**Some users get a body they cannot decode, or everybody gets the French copy.** The response was
correct when it was generated and a cache stored it under the URL alone. Anything that varies the
response by a request header needs that header in `Vary`, and `Accept-Encoding` is the one that
matters most: without it a cache can hand a gzipped body to a client that never asked for one. This
is a cache-key bug, not a serialisation bug, and the tell is that it depends on who got there first.

**`Vary` fixed correctness and destroyed the hit rate.** Every distinct value of a listed header is
a separate stored entry, so `Vary: Cookie` splits the cache per session and `Vary: User-Agent`
splits it per browser build. MDN's caching guide is explicit about both: use `Cache-Control: private`
for responses personalised by cookie, and vary behaviour on feature detection rather than the user
agent string.

**415 Unsupported Media Type on a POST with a perfectly good JSON body.** The body is fine and
`Content-Type` is missing or wrong, so the server's body parser never claimed the request. The same
header has a second job you did not ask for: its value decides whether a cross-origin request needs
a preflight, because only `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` and
`text/plain` skip one. Worth knowing that `application/json` registers no `charset` parameter at
all, and RFC 8259 requires JSON exchanged between systems to be UTF-8, so
`application/json; charset=utf-8` is noise that compliant recipients ignore.
